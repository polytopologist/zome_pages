<b> Introduction</b>
</p>

<p>
This page is about 
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triality">triality</a>"
in the Zome System.
Consider the followiong three Zometool models of the 16-cell:<br>

Zome Projections of the 16-Cell</center>



<p>
Notice that each of these models is uses 8 connectors, 6 R1 struts, 
6 R2 struts, 6 Y2 struts, and 6 B2 struts.  Each model has two 
B2 equilateral triangles, each of which uses three connectors.  For each model,
the two remaining connectors lie on an axis of trihedral symmetry.  For each model,
there is a unique strut type among {R1,R2,Y2} which does not emanate from this
trihedral axis.  We therefore have a sort of triality, provided we ignore
the distinction between yellow and red struts.

Zome Projection of the 24-Cell </p>

<p>
Truncating the regular 16-cell to its edge midpoints yields the regular 24-cell.
As a matter of fact, truncating any one of these models in this manner
yields the same Zome model of the 24-cell.  Thus, we have more evidence
of a triality underlying these models.  We shall see that this triality is a
manifestation of the triality in the D(4) root system.
</p>





<p><b>Quaternions and the 600-Cell</b></p>


<p>
The purpose here is to see a somewhat non-intuitive construction of the 24-cell
using the Zome System model of the regular 600-cell.  This construction reveals that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_icosahedral_group">binary icosahedral group</a>
is intimately related to D(4) triality.
</p>


<p>
The vertex sets for the three models of the 16-cell pictured above are imbedded in 
a particular way in the vertex set for the 600-cell, and there is some convenient
notation for this set if one is willing to work with quaternions.
Let Q={±<b>1</b>,±<b>i</b>,±<b>j</b>,±<b>k</b>} be the usual 8-element 
group of quaternions, where the elements satisfy Hamilton's equation,
<center><b>i</b><sup>2</sup>=<b>j</b><sup>2</sup>=<b>k</b><sup>2</sup>=<b>ijk</b>=-<b>1.</b></center>
Next, let T be the union of Q with the 16 quaternions
obtained from
<center>&frac12;(<b>1</b>+<b>i</b>+<b>j</b>+<b>k</b>)</center>
by applying all possible choices of signs of the coordinates.
The set T is closed under quaternion multiplication and is known as the
binary tetrahedral group.  Moreover,
the set T, as regarded as a subset of <b>R</b><sup>4</sup>, comprise the
vertices of a regular 24-cell.
</p>

<p>
Let b=&frac12;(1+√5) denote the Golden Ratio and a=&frac12;(1-√5) be its 
field-theoretic conjugate, and define a quaternion by
<center><b>x</b>:=&frac12;(-b<b>1</b>+<b>i</b>+a<b>j</b>).</center>
It is routine to verify that <b>x</b><sup>5</sup>=-<b>1</b> under quaternion
multiplication.  The elements of the binary icosahedral group consists of 
the union of the sets
<center>Q,<b>x</b>Q,<b>x</b><sup>2</sup>Q,<b>x</b><sup>3</sup>Q,<b>x</b><sup>4</sup>Q.</center>
</p>

<p>
Next, define the "binary icosahedral
group" I to be the smallest group of quaternions containing <b>i</b> and
&frac12;(a<b>i</b>+<b>j</b>+b<b>k</b>), where b is the Golden Ratio
and a is its field-theoretic conjugate.  Then I contains T as a subgroup,
and it also has the 96 quaternions which can be produced from
<center>&frac12;(a<b>i</b>+<b>j</b>+b<b>k</b>)</center>
by applications of an arbitrary choice of signs and/or an even
permutation of the four coordinates.
</p>

<p>
The elements of the groups Q, T, and I, as expressed here with quaternions,
provide convenient notation for vertex sets of 4-dimensional regular polytopes.
For example, the elements of Q coincide with the vertices of a regular
16-cell, the elements of T are the vertices of a regular 24-cell, and
the elements of I are the vertices of a regular 600-cell.  Moreover,
since quaternion multiplication amounts to an orthogonal transformation,
multiplying any of these sets by a fixed non-zero quaternion also yields 
vertex sets of the same polytopes.
</p>

<p>
If <b>q</b> is any non-zero quaternion, and G is any one of the groups
{Q,T,I}, then let <b>q</b>G (respectively G<b>q</b>) denote the set of all
products of the form <b>qx</b> (respectively <b>xq</b>) where <b>x</b> is
a quaternion in G.
</p>


<p><b>The Zometool Models </b></p>

<p>
In order to see the triality, consider the vertex set 2(1+<b>i</b>)I, obtained by
multiplying each element of I by 2(1+<b>i</b>).  This transformation is a composition
with a "rotation" by π/4 with a dilation by √8.  This set is invariant under the
group generated by all permutations and all even numbers of sign changes in the
four coordinates, but there are four orbits under this action.  We may specify orbit
representatives as
<center>(-b<sup>2</sup>,a,a,a), (32 elements), </center>
<center>(a-b,1,1,1), (32 elements), </center>
<center>(a<sup>2</sup>,b,b,b), (32 elements), </center>
and
<center>(2,2,0,0), (24 elements). </center>
(For notational convenience, we denote the quaternion w+<b>i</b>x+<b>j</b>y+<b>k</b>z by (w,x,y,z).
The last of these orbits is another image of the 24-cell;
in fact, these 24 vectors coincide with the centers of the 
24 octahedra of the 24-cell represented by T, thus
exbihiting its self-duality.  
</p>

<p>
One can see the triality by examining the first three orbits
described above.  Denote 
<center>[a]=(-b<sup>2</sup>,a,a,a)Q, [1]=(a-b,1,1,1)Q, and [b]=(a<sup>2</sup>,b,b,b)Q,</center>
the 16-cells left-induced by (-b<sup>2</sup>,a,a,a), (a-b,1,1,1), and
(a<sup>2</sup>,b,b,b).  Projecting down to 3-space using the mapping p,
one obtains the three Zome models pictured above.  This is where
one should scrutinize the models very carefully.  Only one of these
three models has a pair of balls where only R1's and R2's meet.  This
model is the projection of [1].  The model with R2's and Y2's emanating
from the trihedral axis is the projection of [b], and the
remaining model is the projection of [a].  Evidently, p[b] has
the vertex (b,b,b), p[1] has the vertex (1,1,1), and p[a] has
the vertex (a,a,a).
</p>

<p>
Next, one can check that the union of the three vertex sets of [a], [1], and
[b] coincide with the vertices of a 24-cell.  Indeed, one has
<center>[a]=&frac12;(a-b,1,1,1)(1,1,1,1)Q</center>
and
<center>[b]=&frac12;(a-b,1,1,1)(1,-1,-1,-1)Q.</center>
Since T is the union of Q with &frac12;(1,1,1,1)Q and
&frac12;(1,-1,-1,-1)Q, the union of [a], [1], and [b]
yields a 24-cell.  In fact, one can check this with Zome,
for truncating any one of these polychora to their edge midpoints
yields the same projection of the 24-cell.
