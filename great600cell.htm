<p>
<b>Introduction.</b>
</p>

<p>
Here is a model of the regular polychoron, which, if following an analogue from 3 dimensions,
could be called the "great 600-cell".  The great 600-cell is an assembly of 600 regular tetrahedra
in 4-dimensional space, arranged so that each edge is shared by 5 tetrahedra.  The characteristic
which distinguishes the great 600-cell from the "usual" 600-cell is that the vertex figure is the
great icosahedron.  (The vertex figure for the 600-cell is the regular icosahedron.)
Notice that the Schl&#228;fli symbol here is {3,3,5/2}, indicating that the winding of the 5 tetrahedra
around each edges has multiplicity 2, thus yielding a "pentagram" configuration.
</p>

<p>
More properly speaking, this is an "edge skeleton" of the great 600-cell.  As it turns out, this
Zome model also serves as an edge skeleton for three other regular polychora.  These others have
Schl&#228;fli symbols <br>
<center> {3,5/2,5}, {5/2,5,5/2}, and {5/2,3,5}.</center><br>
One may recognize a sort of duality between these regular polychora and those with
Schl&#228;fli symbols <br>
<center> {3,3,5}, {3,5,5/2}, {5,5/2,5}, and {5,3,5/2}.</center><br>
One switches from one family to the other merely by interchanging "5" with "5/2".

<p><b>Gosset's Polytope 4<sub>21</sub></b></p>

<p>
One may conceive of this model by stellating each of the decagons in the 600-cell to the point
where it becomes a {10/3} decagram.  In so doing, one obtains a polytope containing not
only the vertices of the "usual" 600-cell, but also those of the 600-cell which has
been scaled up by the Golden Ratio.  These vertices are represented by black balls in the
Zome model.
As it turns out, the edges which are present
in this model are images of the edges of the

of Gosset's 8-dimensional semiregular polytope into 3-space.

<p><b>A Peculiarity</b></p>

This model has 60 points where 3 blue struts must intersect.  Unless one makes an impracticably large model,
these are impossible to avoid, even with half-blue struts.  We are lucky that the blue struts bend a lot:
