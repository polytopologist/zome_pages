There appear to be three "natural" Zome models of the 24-cell.  
One is merely a
rhombic dodecahedron with a few more blue and yellow edges thrown in.  Another
is closely related to the Zome model of the 600-cell.  If you can, notice the presence of
"false" vertices in the second model.  The third model uses green lines, which I did not own at the time
of these photos:

One may "snub" the 24-cell in a way similar to the way one constructs the snub cube or snub
dodecahedron.  One replaces each of the 24 octahedra with a regular icosahedron, and replaces
each of the 24 vertices with a particular configuration of 5 tetrahedra.  Each of these configurations is
"tree-like" because one of these tetrahedra is surrounded by the remaining 4.

<p>
This model is obtained from the Zome model of the 600-cell merely by omitting some particular balls and struts.
