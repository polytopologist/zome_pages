      <td width="363" height="155"><p>Here is a Zome
        System model built during the 2001 conference <a href="http://www.sckans.edu/~bridges/">Bridges:&nbsp;
Mathematical Connections in             Art, Music, and Science</a>, in
        Winfield, Kansas.&nbsp; I got
a lot of help from Thomas Engdahl, another participant in the conference, but <a href="http://www.georgehart.com/">George
Hart</a> and <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/~ddunham/">Douglas Dunham</a> also
spent considerable time on it.&nbsp; It took us several hours and over 2000
pieces.&nbsp; George Hart provided most of the pieces.&nbsp; The diameter of the
        completed model was about 4 feet.</p>
<p>This models a projection of a 600-cell which has
been truncated to its edge midpoints.&nbsp; It is comprised of 600 regular
octahedra and 120 regular icosahedra.&nbsp; Two octahedra and one icosahedron
meet at every edge.&nbsp; Five octahedra and two icosahedra meet at every
vertex.&nbsp; There are 10 edges per vertex.&nbsp; It is an example of a convex
uniform polychoron.</p>

        <p>The edges of several uniform polyhedra are
        visible in this model.&nbsp; Specifically, one can see the edges of the
        regular icosahedron, the icosidodecahedron, the rhombicosidodecahedron,
        and the truncated dodecahedron.&nbsp; All of these edges are blue.&nbsp;
        After a little more work, one can find &quot;squashed&quot; versions of
        all of these also.&nbsp; Of course, having the model in front of you
        helps to see these other objects.</p>
