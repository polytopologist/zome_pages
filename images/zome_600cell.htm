<h1 style="margin: auto">The Zometool 600-Cell</h1>

<p>


<font SIZE="+1">This page has step-by-step instructions for the construction of a 
<a href="http://www.zometool.com/">Zometool</a>
model of a projection of the regular polychoron commonly referred to as the "600-cell". 
It is assumed that the user is familiar with the basic terminology
surrounding the Zome system.  One can find an outline of these terms in the most current
Zome Manual or the 
<a href="http://www.zometool.com/pdfs/glossary.pdf">
Glossary</a> at the Zometool website.

<p>
The model constructed on this page is the "large" version.  Using commonly available
parts, one can also build a "small" version of the model.  One accomplishes this
by using the shorter versions of all the pieces used here.  Thus, one may
use B2 struts in place of B3 struts, R1 struts in place of R2 struts, and so on.
</p>

<p>
With four or more people working on it, the construction time is less than an hour.

<p>If you have been counting carefully, you might have noticed that you 
constructed only 270 solid tetrahedra,
despite the fact that this model represents a "600-cell".  
One can explain this disparity
in the numbers after remembering that this model more
accurately represents a <i>projection</i> of the 600-cell into three-dimensional space.
Each of the solid tetrahedra should be counted twice, for the preimage of each
tetrahedron under the projection consists of two tetrahedra.  This yields 540
tetrahedra, so there are still another 60 which appear to be missing.  These 60 tetrahedra
appear on the outer layer of the model.  Each is represented by an isoceles triangle
with 2 Y3 struts and 1 B3 strut.
The reason these don't have as many edges as a tetrahedron is that the projection
completely flattens them.
</p>

<p>
After understanding that all 600 tetrahedra are represented somehow, one
should also check that all 120 vertices, all 720 edges, and all 1200 triangular
faces are also present in some form.  Be careful because a few of the edges are projected
to single points and many triangles are projected to line segments.  
Choosing an edge at random, one should be able to find
a total of 5 tetrahedra and 5 triangles sharing that edge.  Finally, emanating
from each vertex are 12 edges, 30 triangles, and 20 tetrahedra.  The "vertex figure"
for the 600-cell, therefore, is a regular icosahedron.
