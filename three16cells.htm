<b>Introduction.</b>
This is a Zome model of a shadow of the regular compound of three 16-cells.
In order to better understand this model, it is suggested that the reader first
construct both the Zome models of the 
<a href="zometriality.htm">triality of 16-cells</a>
and 
<a href="24cellzome.htm">the 24-cell which has trihedral symmetry</a>.
In building this model, it helps to have the triality of 16-cells on hand
for study.  It also helps to remember that this compound is the first stellation
of the 24-cell, somewhat analogous to the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellated_octahedron">compound of two tetrahedra</a>
being the first stellation of the regular octahedron.

<b>Constructing the Model.</b>
The pictured model uses 36 long blue struts, 36 long yellow struts, 36 long red struts,
36 medium red struts, 8 orange connectors, 8 green connectors, 8 purple connectors,
and 24 white connectors.  The colors of the connectors
are used for distinguishing the 16-cells.  One of the 16-cells
has 8 green connectors as vertices, etc.
</p>

<p>
Start by building an edge-doubled version of one of the 16-cells.  It does not matter which
of the three you choose.  You will eventually make all three.  In order to make an edge-doubled
16-cell, you need 8 connectors for vertices and 24 connectors for the midpoints of the 24 edges,
12 long blue struts, 12 long yellow struts, and 12 long red struts,
12 medium red struts.  In the model pictured, the 24 midpoints are represented by the 24
white connectors.
</p>

<p>
Once you have completed an edge-doubled version of one of the 16-cells,
mount the other two 16-cells in such a way that the 24 midpoints already
present also serve as midpoints for the other two 16-cells.  Remember that these
24 connectors coincide with the connectors in the model of the 24-cell with trihedral
symmetry.  Each of these 24 connectors serve as midpoints for precisely three edges
of the 16-cell, one from each.
</p>

<p>
As you proceed, you will notice some
false vertices.  In the pictured model, you might be able to see that some of the struts
are forced to bend around each other.  If you have some extremely small red struts and a few
more connectors, then you might choose to represent these intersections by connectors.
