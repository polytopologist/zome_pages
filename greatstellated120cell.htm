On Saturday March 24, 2007, we built a Zome model of the final stellation of the 120-cell
at the Lee Honors College at Western Michigan University.  Watch this space, as photos will appear soon.
<br>
<br>
Apparently nobody in the world had ever made a Zome model of this particular mathematical object.
In fact, it's likely that nobody had ever made a 3-dimensional model of it, using
Zome or any other medium.  This construction was recently made possible because 
<a href="http://www.zometool.com/">Zometool</a> 
is working on a new set of parts which may allow users to 
build smaller, lighter models.  They're essentially
scaling down the lengths of their standard parts by the Golden Ratio.
<br>
<br>
The construction took about 6 hours.  We had plenty of help, about 40 people, but, due to the small size
of the model, only a handful of people could work on the model at once.
