<b>Introduction.</b>
The polyhedron underlying the common soccer ball is a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_icosahedron">truncated icosahedron</a>.
It is an Archimedean solid consisting of 12 regular pentagons and 20 regular hexagons.
One may make a model using Zome, using 90 identical blue struts and 60 connectors:

One may also make a "hemi-soccer ball".  Abstractly, this is defined by identifying
points on the soccer ball with their antipodes.  This is essentially the same trick
for obtaining 
<a href="http://homepages.wmich.edu/~drichter/rptwo.htm">the real projective plane</a> 
from the 2-dimensional sphere.
Since the truncated octahedron is invariant under the antipode map, this is well-defined.
The Zome model represents the 1-dimensional skeleton of this polyhedron.

The Complete Graph K<sub>6</sub> and the Hemi-Soccer Ball

<b>Some Details.</b>
Two models appear in the stereogram.  The first is a Zome model of the complete graph 
K<sub>6</sub> on six vertices.  The second is the hemi-soccer ball.  
The complete graph K<sub>6</sub> can be used as a guide for understanding or building 
the hemi-soccer ball.
Notice that K<sub>6</sub> uses 6 distinctly-colored connectors.  Each single vertex
of K<sub>6</sub> corresponds to a cluster of 5 connectors of the same color in the hemi-soccer
ball.  Each commonly colored cluster is spanned by a non-planar pentagon.  These 6 pentagons
(half the number of pentagons in the soccer ball) are connected to each other via
corresponding edges of K<sub>6</sub>.  That is, for every edge of K<sub>6</sub>, there is
a pair of pentagons in the hemi-soccer ball connected by an edge of that type.
The hemi-soccer ball also has 10 hexagons.  By some small miracle, the hexagons in this model
are all flat (affinely spanning only a 2-dimensional space).

<b>The 57-Cell.</b>
In the 1970's and 1980's, Coxeter and Gr&#252;nbaum 
(and others) studied two self-dual abstract regular polytopes,
known as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11-cell">the 11-cell</a> 
and 
<a href="">the 57-cell</a>.
The 1-dimensional skeleton of the 11-cell is simply the complete
graph K<sub>11</sub> on 11 vertices, so a faithful Zome model would be neither interesting
nor possible to build.
One may regard the hemi-soccer ball as a "layer" of the 57-cell.  Specifically,
given any vertex of the 57-cell, there are precisely 30 vertices of distance
2 in the 1-dimensional skeleton, and the connectivity of these vertices coincides
with that of the hemi-soccer ball.
</p>

<b>Linkless Embeddings of Graphs.</b>
The existence of a Zome model of the hemi-soccer ball makes one wonder if it is possible to make then entire
1-dimensional skeleton of the 57-cell using Zome, although it seems highly doubtful.
According to a theorem of Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas, a graph has a linkless embedding
in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup> if and only if it does not have a minor belonging to the 7-member
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petersen_family">Petersen Family</a>.  By construction,
the Zome model of the hemi-soccer ball has a member K<sub>6</sub> as a minor.  One would
be able to say this about every vertex of the 57-cell.  Thus, a Zome model of the 57-cell
would have 57 different copies of the hemi-soccer ball.  This seems to be too many....
